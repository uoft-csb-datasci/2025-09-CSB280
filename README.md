Welcome to the CSB280 course GitHub repository. 

This repository is the source for all datasets and markdown materials produced for students of the course. This respository houses files for only CSB280 - particularly for the Fall 2025 offering. While students will normally use the <a href="https://r.datatools.utoronto.ca/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fuoft-csb-datasci%2F2025-09-CSB280&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=main">nbgitpuller repository link</a> to synchronize their files, students using their own desktop version of RStudio can download repository files weekly to code along with lecture.
